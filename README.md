## Role

React UI interprets Core Appearance and Theme contracts as reusable visual
primitives. The Desktop and Programs compose those primitives instead of
reimplementing material, spacing, color, radius, or interaction behavior.

The package does not depend on a Client or Server runtime and does not own
authoritative application state. React owns runtime-neutral state adaptation;
applications own composition.

## Installation

| Package manager | Command |
| --- | --- |
| npm | `npm install @phreshos/react-ui` |
| pnpm | `pnpm add @phreshos/react-ui` |
| Bun | `bun add @phreshos/react-ui` |
| Yarn | `yarn add @phreshos/react-ui` |

`@phreshos/core`, React, and React DOM are peer dependencies.

```tsx
import { standardAppearance } from "@phreshos/core"
import { AppearanceProvider, Button, Surface } from "@phreshos/react-ui"

<AppearanceProvider appearance={standardAppearance} theme="light">
  <Surface>
    <Button>Continue</Button>
  </Surface>
</AppearanceProvider>
```

See [Appearance](https://docs.phreshos.com/system/appearance) for the contract
interpreted by the provider and components.

## Development

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run verify
```

`verify` checks the contracts, tests the components, builds the package, and
validates its published shape.
